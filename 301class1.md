## Importance

Databases store information and can be used to improve user experience.

## SQL vs NOSQL

### Differences

* SQL is more used for relational data while NoSQL is more used for changing data or unstructed data. (Can also handle semi and structured data)

* SQL represents data in tables and NoSQL can be data in key value pairs, documents, graphs or wide column stores.

* SQL is for vertical scaling and NoSQL is used for horizontal scaling of data. Vertical scaling requires the use of CPU power whilst horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to a database.

* SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. [credit](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

* For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. [credit](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

## Questions

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

* Structured Data

**Give a real world example.**

* Products in a store (Product name/product price)

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

* Unstructured Data, semi and structured data. Also good for handling large amounts of data

**Give a real world example.**

* Social Media posts (images, videos, links)

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

* Graph data base (noSQL)

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

* NoSQL is perfered more due to flexability. But all in all it depends on the data and the wanted use.

## More Questions

**What does SQL stand for?**

* Structured Query Language

**What is a relational database?**

* A table data base with keys and relations

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

* Table.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

* Structure and organzation of data

**What is a NoSQL database?**

* Not only Structured Query Language. Is used for scaling horizontally and dealing with diverse and larger amounts of data.

**How does it work?**

* document, key-value, column-family, or graph (Chatgpt)

**What is inside of a MongoDB database?**

* In MongoDB, data is stored in JSON-like documents. Each document can contain fields with values of different data types. (Chatgpt)

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

* MongoDB can be use multiple fields, data types and data structures at once.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

* less userfriendly because SQL is more standarized and NoSQL is more flexable which is good but also makes it harder because theres diffrent APIs and languages that would need to be learned.
