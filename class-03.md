4. **Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**
* So since c is false java script will just convert it into a number bc that does not make sense and it'll change from false to 0. Then it trys to add a number and a string which does not work either so it'll just change the number into a string and perfrom concatenation. The result will be **10dog**
