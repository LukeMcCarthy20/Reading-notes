## Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
* This topic is very important because we need to be comfortable with basics before moving onto bigger concepts. 

## HTML Questions: 
**Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**

* Semantic elements are important for the web browser and seo. They are also important for accesibility and a user friendly enviorment. 

**How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**
* h1-h6

**What are some uses for the sup and sub elements?**
* Mathematical Formulas: sup is often used for exponents, powers, or indices in mathematical expressions, while sub can be used for subscripts in chemical formulas or mathematical equations. (info from chatgpt)

**When using the abbr element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**

* The abbr element is used to mark up abbreviations or acronyms in HTML. 

## CSS Questions: 
**What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**
* External or internal style sheet and inline

**Why should we avoid using inline styles?**
* Too messy and hard to make changes if wanted.

**Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:**

* **What is representing the selector?-** H2


* **Which components are the CSS declarations?** The color and the padding. 


 **Which components are considered properties?**

 **Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.**

 * We've talked about using functions with loops. Websites that sell clothes or items use loops and functions to help the user find specific items when they search on their website. 

 **An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.**
* A conditonal and true.

**What is the use of an else if?**
 
* The else if statement in programming is used to extend the if statement to handle multiple conditions in a more structured way. (Chatgpt)


**List 3 different types of comparison operators.**
* ===	Strict equality	Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another
* !==	Strict-non-equality	Tests whether the left and right values are not identical to one another	5 !== 2 + 3
* <	Less than	Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one.	10 < 6

**What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?**

* && Means both parts condtions need to be true for it to be true
* || Means either or can be true and the condtion will be true

## Things I want to know more about

* Honestly just JS in general. Need to get more comfortable with the basics.
