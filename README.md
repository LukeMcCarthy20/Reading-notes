## Growth Mindset-
A growth mindset is all about tackling challenges head-on and charging forward to conquer our goals no matter the obstacle. It's like believing in our own evolution and learning with every step.<br>   On the flip side, a fixed mindset is like putting a damper on our goals and feeling stuck in a rut. It's the kind of mindset that holds you from making any real progress.
## Three Reminders
**Embrace challenges**- *Each* challenge you overcome or succeed in will make you ***stronger*** and you can only grow by challening yourself.
**Don't let others success discourage you**- *Instead* of letting other peoples achivements discourage you use it as ***motavation*** to better yourself and give yourself a goal to work towards. Also remember it takes time to get to where they are and most likely didn't come to them naturally.
**Learn from setbacks**- *Reflect* on what went wrong, learn from it, and ***adpat*** your approach. Every setback is a chance to come back stronger.
