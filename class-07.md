* **th** is the header for a table
* **tbody** usually represents rows
* **caption** this element is like a description for the table.

**How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**
* **this.**- in an object is refering to the object that its in.
* **this.**-in a constructor is referring to the object being created.
