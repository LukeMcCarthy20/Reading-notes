Growth Mindset
## Second level
A growth mindset is all about tackling challenges head-on and charging forward to conquer our goals no matter the obstacle. It's like believing in our own evolution and learning with every step. On the flip side, a fixed mindset is like putting a damper on our goals and feeling stuck in a rut. It's the kind of mindset that holds you from making any real progress.
