## Intro
My name is Luke, I am 20 years old and do not have any previous experience in coding besides a class my sophmore year of highschool that sparked my intreset in coding. My computer operating system is windows 11 and my version number is 22H2. I am excited for this class because coding is very enjoyable for me and feels more like a hobby rather than a chore. I'm also excited to work towards expanding my knowledge in coding and for it to hopefully help me towards my future career.
