## Reading

 **How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**
* I would say its a way to store data about something. So example I could make an object called car in my code and hold data for that car like the model, the year, the color, miles, etc. This data can be accessed any time and used in a variety of ways in code. 

 **What are some advantages to creating object literals? How do objects differ from arrays?**
* Object literals are for storing and organzing larger amounts of data or just organzing it diffrently. 
* **Some advantages would be**
* Making keys- this can make your code cleaner and you can also use keys to access your data. 
* You can store arrays and/or any other type of data in it aswell


* **Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**
* If you make a varaible outside of the object. 

* **Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?**

* This. refers to the object and this is good for accessing a specific properties within the object. 

## DOM
**What is the DOM?**
* **Document Object Model**- a programming interface for web documents. 

**Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**

* JavaScript serves as the scripting language that interacts with the DOM, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages.
